## Rise to Fame

Peterson's rise to international prominence began in 2016 when he released a series of videos criticizing Bill C-16, a Canadian bill that proposed adding "gender identity or expression" as a prohibited ground of discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act. Peterson argued that the bill would compel speech by forcing individuals to use preferred gender pronouns, which he viewed as an infringement on free speech. These videos went viral, launching him into the spotlight as a public intellectual and educator ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson)).

In 2018, Peterson published "12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos," a self-help book that became a bestseller. The book offers practical advice on how to live a meaningful life, emphasizing personal responsibility and the importance of finding meaning in life. It has sold over seven million copies worldwide ([Jordan B. Peterson](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/about/)).

## Controversies

Peterson's views have sparked significant controversy and debate. He has been criticized for his comments on gender, identity, and political correctness. For instance, he has referred to feminists as having "an unconscious wish for brutal male domination" and has made controversial statements about transgender individuals, including deadnaming actor Elliot Page ([Vox](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/3/26/17144166/jordan-peterson-12-rules-for-life)).

In 2022, Peterson was suspended from Twitter (now X) for a post about Elliot Page, where he deadnamed the actor and refused to remove the post despite the platform's policies. This incident is one of many where Peterson has faced backlash for his social media activity ([Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/jordan-peterson-accuses-youtube-censorship-auto-fill-1867195)).

Peterson has also had legal battles with the College of Psychologists of Ontario, which received numerous complaints about his online behavior.

In January 2023, an Ontario court dismissed Peterson's appeal to block the college's order for him to undergo remedial social media training ([National Post](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/exclusive-jordan-peterson-loses-fight-with-psychology-college-over-mandatory-social-media-training)).
