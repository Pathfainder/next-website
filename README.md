My personal portfolio site. Made as a hub to show of my projects and skills.

I use this site as a place to learn new frameworks and more, from time to time it may completely change as I try out new things. Currently using NextJs, React and TypeScript.
Previously written in Svelte, Gatsby React and pure HTML.

The site is deployed via Vercel.
